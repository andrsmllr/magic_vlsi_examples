Magic VLSI Examples

This is a collection of simple examples for Magic VLSI from opencircuitdesign.com.
All examples are based on Magic VLSI 8.2.27.

Magic VLSI is a open source software for physical chip layout.
To my knowledge it is one of only two free and open source softwares of this kind.

I recommend to build Magic VLSI from the latest sources
