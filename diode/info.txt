It seems that Magics 'extract' command does only handle transistors and does
not recognize diodes. Different variants to layout a diode were tried.
The SPICE files for each diode variant shows if anything useful was
extracted. This only seems to be the case for the diode emulated by FETs with
gate and source shorted together.
